      <H1>The Paper Roses</H1>
      <p>Hi! We are Laura & Victoria, twins from Yorkshire with a love of paper. We both studied Surface Design for Fashion and Interiors at University, and fell in love with working with paper. We started out making papercuts for friends and family, until we ran out of people to create them for and decided it was time to sell them. We naturally began drawing roses in almost every papercut we were creating, so it seemed only fitting to name our shop 'The Paper Roses'. Every papercut we create is made with the same love and care as if we were giving it to our own family.</P>
